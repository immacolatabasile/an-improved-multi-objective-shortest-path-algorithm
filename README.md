# MDA Demo Project

This project provides a minimal and clear demonstration of a **basic algorithm execution framework**, designed to support and test the **Multiobjective Dijkstra Algorithm (MDA)**.

The goal is to offer a small, self-contained example that highlights how to set up a graph, execute the algorithm, and inspect the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions.
